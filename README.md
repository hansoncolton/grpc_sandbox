# GRPC SandBox

This project is a basic API using gRPC and protobufs in Go

Run go run main.go to run the app, run go build main.go to build an executable file.

The primary goal of this project is to learn more about GoLang and its capabilities. 

This was started by following a tutorial created by Tensor Programming.  Video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y92WWaZJl24
